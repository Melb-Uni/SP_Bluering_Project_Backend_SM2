## Deploy methods

**require python3.7 or higher and MySQL**

1. Installing all packages needed `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if python2 and python3 are both installed, use pip3 and python3)
2. start MySQL server on localhost:3306, and create a database named "sp90013" `CREATE DATABASE sp90013`
3. modify the MySQL username and password config in TeamSPBackend/Settings/dev.py and TeamSPBackend/Settings/prod.py (don't forget to modify 'DATABASES/default/TEST/PASSWORD' in prod.py)
4. create MySQL tables `python manage.py migrate`
5. start server `python manage.py runserver`
6. api web server is now running on: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1


### Structuring files

To create new APIs or extend existing ones, kindly put the API endpoints (URLs) in "TeamSPBackend/api/urls_vX.py" (for version X) with their corresponding API functions. Kindly refer to "TeamSPBackend/api/urls_v1.py" for more info.

The functions called by the API endpoints are created and reside in "TeamSPBackend/api/views". For example, the functions related to any Team APIs reside in "TeamSpBackendd/api/views/team.py". The functions for Confluence and JIRA APIs reside in their own sub-folders ("TeamSPBackend/api/views/confluence" & "TeamSPBackend/api/views/jira") as they are comprised of multiple files.

The database models for the objects used in our APIs are written as modules of their own in "TeamSPBackend".

To create new models and/or APIs utilizing them, kindly follow the current directory structure and format:

- Database models in its own module. E.g. "TeamSPBackend/newModel/" containing the files "app.py" and "models.py"
- Functions for new APIs under "TeamSPBackend/api/views/". E.g. "TeamSPBackend/api/views/newModel.py"
- API endpoints (URLs) in "TeamSPBackend/api/urls_vX.py" for version X
- For any API functions that require multiple files, put those files under a sub-folder in "TeamSPBackend/api/views/". E.g. "TeamSPBackend/api/views/newModel/"
